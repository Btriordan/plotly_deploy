## Goals

Our goals were to show a visually pleasing web page showing the bacteria inside of test subject's belly buttons.

## How?

1. We used different method (map, forEach, sort and filter) to pull the data out of a json type file holding all the data.
2. Using Plotly, we were able to display the top 10 counts of bacteria in each subject and show it on a bar graph.
3. Once again using Plotly, we took all the bacteria found in the subject and created a bubble chart.
    a) The larger the marker the more counts there were. 
4.  Utilizing the forEach and Object.entries functions we were able to show the subjects basic information.
